# A Letter to Regular Users

Dear Friend,

Thank you for your interest in omni-agent. Before you decide whether to use it, I want to explain in the simplest way: **what it is and what it can do for you**.

---

## 🤔 Have You Encountered These Problems?

- 📚 **Too many notes to find** - Work notes, study materials, meeting minutes pile up, and it takes forever to find information
- 🔍 **Inaccurate search** - You remember writing about something, but can't find it with keywords, or too many results to choose from
- 💬 **AI gives wrong answers** - When you ask ChatGPT about your documents, it often makes things up because it doesn't know your content
- 🔗 **Isolated information** - Related content in different documents can't be connected, scattered everywhere even though they're related

If you have these troubles, omni-agent might be for you.

## ✨ What Can omni-agent Do for You?

### 📁 Personal Knowledge Assistant

Imagine:
- You upload all your notes, documents, and study materials to the system
- The system automatically understands the content and establishes connections
- You ask questions anytime, and the system answers accurately based on **your documents**
- The more you use it, the better it understands you, and the more accurate the answers

**Like having your own intelligent librarian.**

### 🎯 What Can It Actually Do?

#### Scenario 1: Query Work Notes
```
You uploaded hundreds of work notes

Question: "What were the key points discussed about the new product last month?"
Answer: Based on your meeting records, precisely summarizes key points and shows related follow-up documents

10x faster than searching yourself, 100x more accurate than ChatGPT
```

#### Scenario 2: Organize Study Materials
```
You uploaded various study materials (PDF, Word, notes)

Question: "What have I learned about this topic before?"
Answer: Automatically links all your related study materials to help you review

Never worry about forgetting what you learned, knowledge truly belongs to you
```

#### Scenario 3: Cross-Document Association
```
You have project documents, requirement specifications, meeting minutes

Question: "How was this feature initially discussed? What changes occurred later?"
Answer: Automatically links documents from different times, connecting the complete story

Like having an assistant with perfect memory, remembering every detail for you
